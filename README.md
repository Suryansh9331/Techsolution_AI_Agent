📌 Overview
Enterprise Customer Support Agent Orchestrator is a multi-agent AI system developed  — a B2B SaaS company specializing in cloud infrastructure management.

This system intelligently classifies, routes, and processes customer support inquiries by orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents.
It combines:

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

External API integrations

A robust orchestration layer

to deliver accurate, context-aware, and unified responses across multiple domains.

🎯 Problem Scenario
TechSolutions receives a high volume of diverse customer support queries, including:

💼 Product Questions – features, specifications, comparisons

🛠 Technical Issues – troubleshooting, diagnostics

💳 Billing & Orders – invoices, payment status

🔀 Multi-part Queries – spanning multiple topics

The challenge was to design a system that can:

🧭 Classify & route inquiries to the correct specialized agents

📄 Extract relevant information from both structured & unstructured data

🔄 Coordinate between agents to produce a single unified response

🌐 Integrate with external APIs/tools when required

⚡ Adapt mid-session without losing conversation context

✨ Features
Multi-Agent Orchestration – Routes queries to the right AI agent for specialized handling.

Context Retention – Maintains conversation flow across multiple turns.

Real-Time API Integrations – Fetches live data for billing, orders, and technical checks.

Modular & Scalable Architecture – Easy to extend with more agents or data sources.

Multi-Part Query Handling – Splits and processes complex inquiries efficiently.

Structured & Unstructured Data Support – Works with knowledge bases, documents, and APIs.

🧩 System Components
1. Router Agent
Categorizes incoming queries

Routes them to the appropriate specialist agent(s)

Splits multi-topic queries into sub-tasks

2. Product Specialist Agent
Uses RAG for product knowledge retrieval

Answers feature & specification queries

Provides product comparisons

3. Technical Support Agent
Diagnoses technical issues

Suggests troubleshooting steps

Escalates unresolved cases with complete context

4. Order/Billing Agent
Fetches order status via API

Handles billing-related inquiries

Presents financial data in a clear format

5. Orchestration Layer
Maintains multi-turn conversation context

Merges multiple agent outputs into a unified response

Ensures smooth agent communication
